# Neutron_Star_Matter
This repository contains the code for my undergraduate thesis (PHY-4002-1) in Physics, conducted at Ashoka University.

Neutron stars offer one of the few natural settings in the universe where matter exists at densities far beyond what can be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories. They provide a unique testing ground for fundamental physics. We predict measurable quantities of neutron stars through theoretical modeling of proposed equations of state, and derive constraints based on observed properties such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability. We find relatively stiffer equations of state are favoured more by current observational data.
