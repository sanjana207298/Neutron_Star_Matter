# Neutron_Star_Matter
This repository contains the code for my undergraduate thesis (PHY-4002-1) in Physics, conducted at Ashoka University.

Neutron stars offer one of the few natural settings in the universe where matter exists at densities far beyond what can be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories. They provide a unique testing ground for fundamental physics. We predict measurable quantities of neutron stars through theoretical modeling of proposed equations of state, and derive constraints based on observed properties such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability. We find relatively stiffer equations of state are favoured more by current observational data.

This contains the following files and folders:\\

The \texttt{lorene} directory contains the subfolder \texttt{lorene\_output\_compiled} along with Jupyter notebooks for computing the \texttt{nrotseq} and \texttt{nrotstar} outputs. The \texttt{lorene\_output\_compiled} folder includes all output data generated by LORENE, which was processed using a custom script that reads the output files and tabulates relevant results for subsequent plotting.

The notebook \texttt{SOLVER.ipynb} contains the primary code for solving the TOV equations for the seven equations of state using the RK45 method, and generates several preliminary plots.

The notebook \texttt{PLOTS.ipynb} includes the code used to generate additional plots that were used in this thesis.

The \texttt{output\_rk45} folder contains the outputs obtained from \texttt{SOLVER.ipynb}.

The \texttt{output\_lsoda} folder includes the outputs generated using SciPyâ€™s \texttt{LSODA} integrator, applied to both linear and cubic spline interpolation schemes.
