# Probing\_Neutron\_Star\_Matter\_Using\_Multimessenger\_Timing\_Results

This repository contains the code for my undergraduate thesis (PHY-4002-1) in Physics, conducted at Ashoka University.

Neutron stars offer one of the few natural settings in the universe where matter exists at densities far beyond what can be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories. They provide a unique testing ground for fundamental physics. We predict measurable quantities of neutron stars through theoretical modeling of proposed equations of state, and derive constraints based on observed properties such as mass, radius, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability. We find that relatively stiffer equations of state are more favored by current observational data.

## Contents

* **`lorene/`**
  Contains the subfolder `lorene_output_compiled` along with Jupyter notebooks for computing the `nrotseq` and `nrotstar` outputs. The `lorene_output_compiled` folder includes all output data generated by LORENE, which was processed using a custom script that reads the output files and tabulates relevant results for subsequent plotting.

* **`SOLVER.ipynb`**
  This notebook contains the primary code for solving the TOV equations for seven equations of state using the RK45 method and generates several preliminary plots.

* **`PLOTS.ipynb`**
  Includes the code used to generate additional plots that were incorporated into the thesis.

* **`output_rk45/`**
  Contains the outputs obtained from `SOLVER.ipynb`.

* **`output_lsoda/`**
  Includes the outputs generated using SciPyâ€™s `LSODA` integrator, applied to both linear and cubic spline interpolation schemes.
